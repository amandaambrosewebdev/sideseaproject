# sideseaproject
This is the test project I completed for Side Sea. I created just a basic footer.php and header.php file, and index.php with the main content. For the header and content, I used pre-made components from Foundations. I have used Bootstrap in the past. I created dynamic content in the header and footer areas using php bloginfo and date. I didn't put much into styling since I was using the premade components available on Foundations. Hopefully I understood the directions correctly. I just created my own theme file instead of using / editing the sidesea theme. I also made sure to include a screenshot file that would show up as the thumbnail image under appearance > themes. I only pushed the code I made changes to here, which is why there are only a few files. When I was creating this using MAMP, I created the theme under wp-content > themes > amandaTestTheme. The main folder that I cloned from the github link, I placed in the htdocs file of MAMP.
